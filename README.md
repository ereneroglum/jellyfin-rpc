# Jellyfin/Feishin RPC

Not to be confused with [jellyfin-rpc by Radiicall](https://github.com/Radiicall/jellyfin-rpc).  
This is a Python app that displays the currently playing song from [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/) (or [Feishin](https://github.com/jeffvli/feishin)) on your discord profile.  

This app has two files:
- Jellyfin RPC (for anything Jellyfin related)
- MPRIS RPC (intended for Feishin, or any other MPRIS-based clients)

You will need to customize your configuration depending on the one you will be using.

# (optional) Use a public imgproxy server? (needed most of the time)
# Obviously, you can self host your own imgproxy server as desired.
imageproxy_enabled = true
imageproxy_url = "https://images.iipython.dev"

# (optional) The public URL of your server (for port-forwarded album art, passed to imgproxy)
# Leave this BLANK if you don't want to edit the url your client sends

# Recommended to be as fast as possible for your hardware without causing
# a major performance impact.

# You can usually find this using a dbus client such as qdbus, however milage may vary
